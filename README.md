# php-mail-generator

This is a simple Vue.js web application that generates PHP code to send an email. It ensures the required headers are present to get you started, but does not include all of the available options for the PHP `mail()` function. 

For more options and other headers available, see the
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php">PHP manual</a>.
